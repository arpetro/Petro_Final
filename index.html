			<h2> <strong> Hate Crime Rates Are Declining. Coincidentally, So Are Reports </strong>

			<p style="color: darkslategrey;">According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1165Oj9EkRzNDS4jADZ3loc71PR7PgkOl-GUmSDmkJ2w/edit#gid=1368412066" target="_blank">an analysis of recent NYPD data</a>, hate crimes in NYC have been decreasing as of late 2022. This shocking statistic makes us wonder: within three years of the Black Lives Matter movement, Stop Asian Hate, and the recent proposal of various anti-drag bills, it is unexpected that the number of hate crimes would decline. However, what we might not realize is that alongside the decrease in incidents comes another frightening trend: a decrease in reporting.</p>

			<h3><strong>What Classifies a Hate Crime?</strong></h3>
			<p style="color: darkslategrey;"><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime-faqs#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20hate%20crime%3F%20The%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20UCR,disability%2C%20sexual%20orientation%2C%20ethnicity%2C%20gender%2C%20or%20gender%20identity" target="_blank">The FBI</a> defines a hate crime as “a committed criminal offense which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias(es) against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” This could be an incident of physical violence, harassment, or bullying in school. </p>

			<p style="color: darkslategrey;"> According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1165Oj9EkRzNDS4jADZ3loc71PR7PgkOl-GUmSDmkJ2w/edit#gid=1368412066" target="_blank">an analysis of data from the NYPD,</a> Jewish people were victims of the most hate crimes in 2022. Though this statistic shouldn’t by any means be ignored, we must also question why we see significantly less reports from other minorities. The truth is, we only know what gets reported to the authorities. The lack of reporting could be due to a number of reasons, such as language barriers, discomfort towards law enforcement, or the victim may come from a country where reporting isn’t as normalized. According to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes" target="_blank">The United States Department of Justice</a>, about a quarter of hate crime victims who did not report believed that the police did not want to be bothered, would not help the issue, or would cause more trouble. About one in five victims felt that the crime wasn’t important enough to report. This being said, we must examine how the trend affects victims on a federal level as well.</p>

			<h3><strong>What About Federal Reports?</strong></h3>
			<p style="color: darkslategrey;">To report a hate crime, one must prove that the incident was motivated by bias, which is not a simple feat. Not only this, but one might not even realize that they are a victim of a hate crime. With these limitations in mind, the FBI has been working to improve their data regarding hate crimes. As of 2021, they attempted to change their method of reporting. This new method was intended to collect more thorough data from law enforcement. However, this was not the case. With <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/6/23389507/murder-crime-rate-fbi-report" target="_blank">this new system,</a> only 52% of the federal population lived somewhere where police reported a full 12 months of data.</p> 

			<p style="color: darkslategrey;">The FBI already relies on data that is voluntarily reported, which is difficult to enforce. However, this is not their only limitation. According to the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/12/13/2021-fbi-hate-crime-data-incomplete" target="_blank">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, 3,500 agencies failed to submit their data to the FBI in 2020. Among these agencies who failed to report, there were ten cities with populations of 100,000. With so much potential data missing, numbers can easily be misinterpreted, and we might mistake the lack of numbers for a decrease in incidents.</p>

			<h3><strong>So What Are We Doing to Improve?</strong></h3>
			<p style="color: darkslategrey;">Some might suggest that a likely solution is to make reporting mandatory. Although this sounds great in theory, it might not be realistic, given the probable reasons for underreporting. <a href="https://criminaljustice.cityofnewyork.us/about-us/" target="_blank">The Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice in NYC</a> is working to encourage reporting. Hassan Syed Naveed, the Executive Director of their Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, hopes to fill in data gaps. </p>

				<div class= ".quotes">			
					<p>“Data can be an indicator but not the whole story," he says.</p>
				</div>

			<p style="color: darkslategrey;">It is encouraged that we cross reference data in order to accurately understand the numbers. For example, through his work, Naveed found that approximately 50% of hate crimes go unreported. However, he is optimistic that this will change sooner than later. He works with over 60 hate crime prevention organizations across New York City with the goal of eliminating this lack of data. </p>

			<h3><strong>How Can We Help?</strong></h3>
			<p style="color: darkslategrey;">Naveed states that the most important action to take is to “build a culture where people are comfortable to talk”. This encourages victims to come forward when they have experienced a hate crime. He states that this would allow for safe intervention that would keep the victim out of harm’s way. He also emphasizes the importance of education on these issues. This would allow victims to realize that they have experienced a hate crime and know how to report it.</p>

			<p style="color: darkslategrey;">Finally, he highlights the importance of creating a neighborly relationship with those around us. According to Naveed, we are less social today than ever before. </p>

			<div class=".quotes">
			<p style="color: black;"> "We live in bubbles, and it’s important to break down these silos in order to truly understand each other," Naveed explains.</p>
			</div>

			<p style="color: darkslategrey;"> When we connect with those around us, we create an environment where people not only feel comfortable to talk but also understand each other. We can begin to understand backgrounds that are different from our own, which decreases bias that might lead to a hate crime. Naveed is hopeful that with this action, hate crimes will decrease, and we can move towards a world without bias.</p>
